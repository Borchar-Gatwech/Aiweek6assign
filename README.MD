Overview

This assignment explores the future directions of Artificial Intelligence through both theoretical analysis and practical implementation. It covers emerging technologies like Edge AI and Quantum AI, alongside hands-on development of intelligent systems optimized for IoT and edge devices.

Part 1: Theoretical Analysis

Q1. Edge AI – Reducing Latency and Enhancing Privacy
Edge AI processes data locally on devices, minimizing latency, improving privacy, and enabling real-time responses. Example: autonomous drones using onboard AI for obstacle detection and navigation.

Q2. Quantum AI vs Classical AI in Optimization Problems
Quantum AI leverages qubits and superposition to explore many solutions simultaneously, outperforming classical AI in optimization tasks for industries like finance, logistics, and pharmaceuticals.

Part 2: Practical Implementation

Task 1: Edge AI Prototype – Smart Recycling Classifier
Developed an image classification model (using TensorFlow & TensorFlow Lite) for recognizing flower types.

Dataset: tf_flowers

Model: MobileNetV2 (optimized for edge)

Output: ~85% accuracy, deployed via TFLite

Benefits: Low latency, offline operation, improved privacy

Task 2: AI-Driven IoT Concept – Smart Agriculture
Proposed an IoT system for soil monitoring and crop yield prediction using sensors (moisture, temperature, pH, humidity, light).

Model: Random Forest regression

Edge Processing: Local predictions on devices (e.g., Raspberry Pi)

Impact: Water efficiency, sustainability, and data-driven farming
